# 🎯 Recommendation System Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

This is the backend service for the Recommendation System project built using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**. It provides APIs for managing users, items, and user-item interactions.

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PostgreSQL (locally or cloud instance)
- pip (Python package installer)

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, make sure you’re in your project’s root directory.

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-multipart
````

If you're using a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure `requirements.txt` contains all necessary packages. If not, create it with:
>
> ```bash
> pip freeze > requirements.txt
> ```

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: PostgreSQL Setup

Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running locally.

Open your terminal or pgAdmin and create a database named:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE recommend_db;
```

Update your `app/database.py` with your DB credentials:

```python
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost/recommend_db"
```

---

## 📁 Step 3: Navigate to Backend Directory

```bash
cd backend
```

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Run FastAPI Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

* The API will now be live at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
* Swagger docs available at: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

---

## 🧪 Sample API Routes

Here are a few working routes:

* `GET /` — Basic health check
* `POST /users/` — Create a user
* `POST /items/` — Add an item
* `POST /interactions/` — Log a user-item interaction
* `GET /interactions/` — Filter interactions by user\_id, item\_id, or type

```

## 📌 Notes

* Make sure PostgreSQL is running before you start the FastAPI server.
* If you change the schema, don’t forget to run migrations or update models manually.
* This backend is part of a larger project including a frontend and recommendation logic.
