🗓️ Week 1: Setup
✅ Installed and ran FastAPI

✅ Created project structure (main.py, routes, models, schemas, etc.)

✅ Connected PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy

✅ Created users, items, interactions tables in PostgreSQL

🗓️ Week 2: Logging and Upload
✅ Built the CSV upload API /interactions/upload_csv/

You tested it with a CSV having 4998 rows — and it worked!

✅ Created and tested real-time logging endpoint /interactions/log/

You sent user click data and saw it inserted into the DB.

✅ Table columns like interaction_type, timestamp were created and being used.

✅ Handled some issues like missing columns, table not found — and you fixed them all with migrations or recreation.
